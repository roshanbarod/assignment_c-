Que-11:List at least three advantages of using OOP in software development.

Advantages of Using OOP in Software Development
Modularity & Organized Code

Why? Code is structured into reusable classes and objects, mirroring real-world entities (e.g., User, Product).

Example:

cpp
class User {  
private:  
    string name;  
public:  
    void setName(string n) { name = n; }  
};  
Benefit: Easier to debug, update, and collaborate on large projects.

Code Reusability (Inheritance)

Why? Child classes inherit features from parent classes, eliminating duplicate code.

Example:

cpp
class Animal { public: void eat() { /*...*/ } };  
class Dog : public Animal { /* Inherits eat() */ };  
Benefit: Faster development and consistent logic across related classes.

Data Security (Encapsulation)

Why? Data is private by default and accessed via controlled methods.

Example:

cpp
class BankAccount {  
private:  
    double balance;  
public:  
    void deposit(double amount) { /* Validate amount */ }  
};  
Benefit: Prevents accidental data corruption and enforces validation rules.
