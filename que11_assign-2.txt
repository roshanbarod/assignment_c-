11. How does call by reference differ from call by value?
Feature	Call by Value	Call by Reference
What is passed	A copy of the variable	A reference (alias) to the variable
Modifies original?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Memory usage	More (due to copying)	Less
Safety	Safe (original data is unchanged)	Riskier (original data can change)

Example:


void byValue(int a) { a = 10; }
void byRef(int &a) { a = 10; }
