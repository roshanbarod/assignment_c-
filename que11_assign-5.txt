11. How Does Call by Reference Differ from Call by Value?
The main difference lies in whether the function receives a copy of the variable or a reference to the original variable.

Feature	Call by Value	Call by Reference
What is passed?	A copy of the variable	A reference (alias) to the variable
Changes reflect back?	No	Yes
Use case	When you donâ€™t want to alter data	When you need to alter original data
Syntax	void func(int x)	void func(int &x)

Example Comparison
Call by Value:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void setValue(int x) {
    x = 20;
}
int a = 10;
setValue(a);
// a is still 10
Call by Reference:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void setValue(int &x) {
    x = 20;
}
int a = 10;
setValue(a);
// a is now 20
