13. What is an Inline Function in C++?
An inline function is a function for which the compiler attempts to insert the functionâ€™s body directly into the places where the function is called, rather than performing a regular function call.

a. Syntax
cpp
Copy
Edit
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
b. Purpose and Use
Eliminates function call overhead.

Used for short, frequently called functions.

Can improve performance in time-critical applications.

c. How It Works
Instead of this:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int result = square(4);
The compiler replaces it with:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int result = 4 * 4;
This avoids a jump to a separate function location, thus saving time.

d. Advantages
Faster execution for small functions.

Useful in templates and header files.

e. Limitations
The compiler may ignore the inline request if the function is too complex.

Inlining increases the size of binary code (code bloat) if overused.

f. Best Practice
Use inline functions only for small, frequently-used code blocks that are not likely to cause significant code bloat.
