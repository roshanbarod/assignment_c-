Que-18:-.What are identifiers in C++? What rules must be followed when creating them?

Identifiers in C++
Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, and other user-defined elements in C++ code. They serve as labels to uniquely identify these entities.

Rules for Naming Identifiers
1. Valid Characters
Can include:

Letters (A-Z, a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Underscores (_)

Must start with a letter or underscore (_).

✅ Valid: count, _temp, var1

❌ Invalid: 1var, @value, #name

2. Case Sensitivity
C++ is case-sensitive:

age ≠ Age ≠ AGE

3. No Reserved Keywords
Cannot use C++ keywords (e.g., int, class, return) as identifiers.

✅ Valid: myInt, ClassData

❌ Invalid: int, class

4. No Special Characters
Spaces, @, #, $, etc., are not allowed.

✅ Valid: total_amount

❌ Invalid: total amount, amount@cash

5. Length Limit
Most compilers support up to 255 characters, but shorter, meaningful names are preferred.

Examples of Valid vs. Invalid Identifiers
Valid Identifiers	Invalid Identifiers	        Reason
age	                1age	                    Starts with a digit
_count	            float	                    Reserved keyword (float)
totalAmount	        total-amount	            Hyphen (-) not allowed
MAX_SPEED	        MAX SPEED	                Space not allowed

Best Practices for Naming Identifiers
Use descriptive names (e.g., studentAge instead of x).

Follow a consistent convention:

camelCase (variables, functions)

PascalCase (classes, structs)

UPPER_CASE (constants, macros)

Avoid single letters (except in loops, e.g., i, j).
