15. Example of a Class with Static Data and Function Members
cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    static int count;  // Static data member (shared among all objects)

public:
    Counter() {
        count++;  // Increment count when an object is created
    }

    static int getCount() {  // Static member function
        return count;
    }
};

// Initialize static member outside the class
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3;
    cout << "Total objects created: " << Counter::getCount() << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
count is shared across all Counter objects.

getCount() is called without an object (Counter::getCount()).
