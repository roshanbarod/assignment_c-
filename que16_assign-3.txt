16. What is a Constructor in C++ and Why is it Important?
A constructor is a special member function that:

Has the same name as the class.

Is automatically called when an object is created.

Initializes object data members.

Does not have a return type (not even void).

Why Constructors are Important?
Automatic Initialization: Ensures objects start in a valid state.

Prevents Uninitialized Data: Avoids undefined behavior.

Supports Overloading: Can define multiple ways to initialize objects.

Resource Allocation: Used for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., opening files, network connections).
