17. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using macros over inline functions:

Advantages of Macros:

Simpler and faster to write for very short and repetitive code.

Useful for conditional compilation using #ifdef, #endif.

Disadvantages of Macros:

No type safety: Parameters aren't type-checked.

No scoping rules: Can lead to naming conflicts.

Difficult to debug: Errors in macros are harder to trace.

Unintended side effects: Due to multiple evaluations.

Advantages of Inline Functions:

Type-safe: Arguments are checked for type correctness.

Easier to debug.

Obey scope rules.

Disadvantages of Inline Functions:

Code bloat: Excessive inlining increases binary size.

Not guaranteed: Compiler may choose not to inline
