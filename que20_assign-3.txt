20. Copy Constructor and Its Purpose
A copy constructor creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

Purpose:
Used when:

An object is passed by value to a function.

An object is returned by value from a function.

An object is explicitly copied (Point p2 = p1;).

Example:
cpp
class Point {
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(const Point &p) {  // Copy constructor
        x = p.x;
        y = p.y;
    }
};
