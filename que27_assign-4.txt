27. Late Binding (Dynamic Binding)
What it is: Resolving function calls at runtime (via vtables) rather than compile-time.

Context: Used with virtual functions when called via base pointers/references.

Advantage: Enables polymorphic behavior.

Example:
cpp
Base* b = new Derived();
b->virtualFunction();  // Late binding: calls Derived::virtualFunction()
