29. Abstract Class in C++
An abstract class is a class that:

Contains at least one pure virtual function (= 0).

Cannot be instantiated (no objects can be created).

Serves as a base class for derived classes to implement its interface.

Example:
cpp
class Shape {  // Abstract class
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};
