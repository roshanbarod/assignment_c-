2. Significance of the Return Type of the main Function

The return type of the main function in C++ is int, which indicates that it returns an integer value to the operating system upon completion. This return value is essential as it tells the system or the shell whether the program ended successfully or encountered an error. By convention:

return 0; means that the program executed successfully.

Any non-zero return value signals that there was an error or abnormal termination.

This return mechanism is useful for scripting and automation, where the success or failure of a program needs to be detected programmatically. The operating system or calling script can inspect this return code and make decisions based on it.

Although older compilers may allow void main(), this is not standard-compliant. According to the C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882), the correct signature of main must return int. Using the correct return type ensures portability and standard compliance.

The return value is especially useful in larger systems or development environments where a build script or test runner needs to determine whether a process completed as expected. By returning different values for different kinds of failures, the program can communicate specific error conditions.

In conclusion, the int return type for main serves a functional purpose beyond syntax; it is a communication tool between the program and its execution environment, and its use should not be neglected.
