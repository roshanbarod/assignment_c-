2. What is a class in C++ and how does it differ from an object?
A class is a user-defined blueprint or template that describes the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that objects of that class will have. An object is a concrete instance created from a class.

Difference:

Class is a template (like a blueprint for a house)

Object is an instance (like an actual house built from the blueprint)
