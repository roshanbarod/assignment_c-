2. Explain the Significance of the Return Type of the main() Function
In C++, the return type of the main() function is typically int, which is used to return an exit status to the operating system. This status code is a convention used by the OS to determine whether a program executed successfully.

a. Return 0: Success
Returning 0 from main() conventionally signals that the program has completed without errors.

cpp
Copy
Edit
int main() {
    // Code
    return 0; // indicates success
}
b. Non-Zero Return: Failure
Returning a non-zero value indicates an error. This helps in debugging and scripting when running batch processes.

cpp
Copy
Edit
int main() {
    // Error condition
    return 1; // indicates an error occurred
}
c. Why int and Not void?
While some compilers allow main() with a return type of void, this is non-standard and not portable. The C++ standard requires the return type of main() to be int. This ensures compatibility across platforms and compilers.

Returning a value from main() enables external programs, shell scripts, or the operating system to make decisions based on the success or failure of the program
