39. How the throw Keyword Works in Exception Handling
The throw keyword raises an exception, which can be:

A built-in type (int, const char*).

A standard exception (std::runtime_error).

A custom exception class.

Example:
cpp
double divide(double a, double b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw "Division by zero!"; // Throws a C-string
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    try {
        cout << divide(10, 0);
    } catch (const char* msg) {
        cerr << "Error: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Output:

Error: Division by zero!
Key Points:

throw transfers control to the nearest matching catch block.

If no matching catch is found, the program terminates (std::terminate is called).
