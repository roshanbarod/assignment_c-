3. Explain the concept of encapsulation with an example.
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

Example:

cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // hidden data

public:
    void deposit(double amount) {  // controlled access
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
    
    double getBalance() {  // controlled access
        return balance;
    }
};
