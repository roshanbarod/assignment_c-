42. Templates in C++ and Their Usefulness
Templates enable generic programming by allowing functions/classes to operate on any data type.

Why Useful?

Code Reusability: Write once, use with any type.

Type Safety: Avoids macros/void pointers.

Performance: Resolved at compile-time (no runtime overhead).

Types:

Function templates (generic functions).

Class templates (generic classes).
