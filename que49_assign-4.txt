49. Advantages of Templates Over Traditional Inheritance
Feature	Templates	Inheritance
Type Safety	✅ Compile-time checks	❌ May require runtime checks
Performance	✅ No runtime overhead (resolved at compile time)	❌ Virtual function overhead
Code Reusability	✅ Single implementation for all types	❌ Requires separate derived classes
Flexibility	✅ Works with any type	❌ Limited to class hierarchies
Compilation Time	❌ Slower (due to multiple instantiations)	✅ Faster
When to Use Which?
Use templates when you need generic algorithms (e.g., sort, vector).

Use inheritance when you need runtime polymorphism (e.g., Animal → Dog).
