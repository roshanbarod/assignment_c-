50. Virtual Base Class in C++
Purpose:

Solves the "diamond problem" in multiple inheritance.

Ensures only one copy of a base class is inherited when multiple paths exist.

Diamond Problem Example:
cpp
class A { public: int x; };
class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};
class D : public B, public C {};  // ‚ùå Two copies of 'A' in 'D'
