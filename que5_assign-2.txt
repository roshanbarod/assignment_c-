5. How do you declare a function prototype for a function that returns an integer and takes two integer parameters?
A function prototype with this signature would look like:


int add(int a, int b);
You can also omit parameter names:


int add(int, int);
Both are valid and tell the compiler that:

A function named add exists.

It takes two int parameters.

It returns an int.
