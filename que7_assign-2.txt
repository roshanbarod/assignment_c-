7. What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function?
Aspect	                    Declaration	                                                    Definition
Purpose	     Tells the compiler about a functionâ€™s existence	Provides actual implementation (body)
Ends with	                       Semicolon (;)	             Function body in {} braces
Example	int add(int, int);	                                int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
Required?	Yes, if the function is called before its definition	Always required eventually

A function can be declared multiple times, but it should be defined only once.
