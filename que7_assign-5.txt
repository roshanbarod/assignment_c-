7. What Is the Difference Between a Declaration and a Definition of a Function?
Understanding the difference between declaration and definition is crucial in C++.

a. Declaration
A declaration tells the compiler about a function’s name, return type, and parameters but does not specify what the function does.

cpp
Copy
Edit
int multiply(int, int); // This is a declaration (or prototype)
b. Definition
A definition includes the actual body of the function — it tells the compiler what the function does.

cpp
Copy
Edit
int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}
c. Key Differences
Aspect	Declaration	Definition
Purpose	Introduces function	Implements function
Body present?	No	Yes
Multiple allowed?	Yes	No (only one per function)

A function must be defined once but can be declared multiple times, often in multiple files via header files.
